# Challenge 2: Portfolio | QS

For this week's challenge, we developed an interactive random password generator. The password generator is available [here](https://quaylas.github.io/qs.passwordgenerator.wk3/). 

Users may indicate the desired password length (8-128 characters) as well as what character types should be included.
